    Calculate the times when a satellite crosses a specific elevation during a pass.

    This function samples the satellite's elevation at regular intervals during the pass
    and finds when it crosses the target elevation threshold on both the ascending portion
    (from AOS to peak) and descending portion (from peak to LOS).

    Args:
        satellite_tle: Dictionary containing 'tle1' and 'tle2' keys with TLE lines
        home_location: Dictionary containing 'lat' and 'lon' keys for observer location
        aos_time: Acquisition of Signal time (start of pass)
        los_time: Loss of Signal time (end of pass)
        target_elevation: Target elevation in degrees (e.g., 10.0)

    Returns:
        Tuple of (ascending_crossing_time, descending_crossing_time)
        Either or both can be None if elevation is never reached
